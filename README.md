# 👋 Hey, I'm Rahul

I'm a machine learning engineer who’s fascinated by how machines learn to perceive the world — especially through vision. I love the intersection of code, intelligence, and reality.

## 🧠 What Drives Me

I like solving practical problems using smart systems — things that make devices more aware, interfaces more seamless, and interactions more human.  

Over the years, I’ve worked with patterns, pixels, and probabilities — building models that are not just accurate, but fast, efficient, and usable.

I’m always trying to bridge the gap between research and production, experimentation and real-world value.

## 🔧 What I’m Into

- Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
- Computer Vision (object detection, restoration, gaze tracking, etc.)  
- On-device AI & model optimization  
- Clean code, creative problem solving, and continuous learning

## 📚 Learning + Exploring

- Model optimization techniques (quantization, parallelization)  
- Statistical modeling and probabilistic thinking  
- Real-time performance tuning for AI applications  
- Synthetic data generation for computer vision  
- Scalable AI architecture and tooling (Keras, TensorFlow, etc.)
