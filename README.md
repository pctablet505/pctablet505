# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Rahul

Iâ€™m someone who enjoys making machines a little smarter every day. Most of my time goes into building systems that can see, understand, and respond â€” especially when it comes to vision and pattern recognition.

## ðŸ§  What Drives Me

I like solving real-world problems with machine learning â€” not just to make models accurate, but to make them useful.  

My work focuses on designing intelligent systems that are fast, efficient, and actually deployable. Iâ€™m especially into optimizing models, reducing latency, and finding creative ways to solve problems at scale.

## ðŸ”§ Interests

- Computer Vision  
- Deep Learning & Model Optimization  
- On-device AI (low-latency, quantized models)  
- Data-driven storytelling  
- Building systems that actually get shipped

## ðŸ§° Tools I Use Regularly

`Python` `C++` `Java` `TensorFlow` `Keras` `PyTorch` `OpenCV`  
`Docker` `Scikit-learn` `Flask` `Django` `SQL` `Git`

## ðŸ“š Currently Exploring

- Better performance with smaller models  
- Synthetic data generation techniques  
- Making AI systems explainable and more human-aware  
- Leveraging statistical thinking for smarter ML pipelines
